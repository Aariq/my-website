I've always thought I should eventually have a profesional website for job hunting, but recently I've realized that it would be nice to have somewhere to collect my thoughts and contributions all in one place.
Before having a website of my own, I generally shared updates and thoughts on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/LeafyEricScott) and on [other people's blogs](#blogs), which I will still continue to do, but having everything I do in one place seems like a good idea. I kept putting off making a website until I was recently encouraged by a combination of envy of my [officemate's awesome looking website](https://www.rachaelebonoan.com/), and learning that one could make a website using RStudio and the [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) R package.  I just spent a semester learning a ton about R Markdown, the file type blogdown uses to construct websites, for a [biostatistics course](https://github.com/Aariq/biostats-recitation) I was teaching, so I figured using R Markdown to make a website would be relatively easy.  Fortunately, I was correct!  I spent about 3-4 work days initially getting this website working and customized, and it was relatively painless.  Compared to, say WordPress, the impressiveness-to-effort ratio is much higher, in my opinion.

## Getting started with Blogdown
Basically blogdown builds a website from a series of Markdown or R Markdown documents.  Markdown and the more R-specific version, R Markdown, are really simple languages for creating formatted HTML documents.  For example, you can create headers like the one at the start of this paragraph simply by adding different numbers of "#", and turn a word into a link with square brackets followed by a URL. When the Markdown is converted to HTML, those special characters get converted into the relevant HTML code. Blogdown adds some features to R Studio that make it easier to import themes to help you get started, write new blog posts, and view changes to your website "live."

The [tutorial for blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/get-started.html) is great, but I found that choosing a [theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/) early on was important, because a lot of what I needed to learn and figure out was specific to the theme. In fact, using blogdown wasn't really as helpful as I thought for editing the theme I chose, as the example pages in the theme were written in a different format (Markdown with TOML headers) than the default for a new blogdown post (R Markdown with YAML header). That being said, the example Markdown documents that came with the theme were well annotated and for the most part all I had to do was fiddle around with values and add my own text and images.

## Building and Hosting a website
I decided to go with blogdown's recomendation to build and host my website using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).  The tutorials on Netlify are very jargon-y and I got basically nothing out of them.  Fortunately, the [chapter on Netlify](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/netlify.html) in the blogdown book was very helpful.  Netlify builds your website from a GitHub repository containing all the Markdown or R Markdown files you've created.  Fortunately, I had just recently figured out (after *much* failure) how to link GitHub to R Studio thanks to [Jenny Bryan](http://happygitwithr.com/), so it was just a matter of pushing updates to my website to GitHub and following the blogdown tutorial to build the website.

## Want to make a website? Just try it!
All of this was completely free, and if you have *some* knowledge of R Markdown it is super easy to get started.  Even if you've never used R Markdown, it's not hard to learn. Depending on the theme you choose, you could get a website up and running in a day or two easily. Feel free to check out the [source documents](https://github.com/Aariq/my-website) for this website. I think you'll find that they are not as intimidating as you might think!

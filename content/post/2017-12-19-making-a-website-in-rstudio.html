<p>I’ve always thought I should eventually have a profesional website for job hunting, but recently I’ve realized that it would be nice to have somewhere to collect my thoughts and contributions all in one place. Before having a website of my own, I generally shared updates and thoughts on <a href="https://twitter.com/LeafyEricScott">Twitter</a> and on <a href="#blogs">other people’s blogs</a>, which I will still continue to do, but having everything I do in one place seems like a good idea. I kept putting off making a website until I was recently encouraged by a combination of envy of my <a href="https://www.rachaelebonoan.com/">officemate’s awesome looking website</a>, and learning that one could make a website using RStudio and the <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">blogdown</a> R package. I just spent a semester learning a ton about R Markdown, the file type blogdown uses to construct websites, for a <a href="https://github.com/Aariq/biostats-recitation">biostatistics course</a> I was teaching, so I figured using R Markdown to make a website would be relatively easy. Fortunately, I was correct! I spent about 3-4 work days initially getting this website working and customized, and it was relatively painless. Compared to, say WordPress, the impressiveness-to-effort ratio is much higher, in my opinion.</p>

<h2>Getting started with Blogdown</h2>
<p>Basically blogdown builds a website from a series of Markdown or R Markdown documents. Markdown and the more R-specific version, R Markdown, are really simple languages for creating formatted HTML documents. For example, you can create headers like the one at the start of this paragraph simply by adding different numbers of “#”, and turn a word into a link with square brackets followed by a URL. When the Markdown is converted to HTML, those special characters get converted into the relevant HTML code. Blogdown adds some features to R Studio that make it easier to import themes to help you get started, write new blog posts, and view changes to your website “live.”</p>
<p>The <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/get-started.html">tutorial for blogdown</a> is great, but I found that choosing a <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/">theme</a> early on was important, because a lot of what I needed to learn and figure out was specific to the theme. In fact, using blogdown wasn’t really as helpful as I thought for editing the theme I chose, as the example pages in the theme were written in a different format (Markdown with TOML headers) than the default for a new blogdown post (R Markdown with YAML header). That being said, the example Markdown documents that came with the theme were well annotated and for the most part all I had to do was fiddle around with values and add my own text and images.</p>

<h2>Building and Hosting a website</h2>
<p>I decided to go with blogdown’s recomendation to build and host my website using <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>. The tutorials on Netlify are very jargon-y and I got basically nothing out of them. Fortunately, the <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/netlify.html">chapter on Netlify</a> in the blogdown book was very helpful. Netlify builds your website from a GitHub repository containing all the Markdown or R Markdown files you’ve created. Fortunately, I had just recently figured out (after <em>much</em> failure) how to link GitHub to R Studio thanks to <a href="http://happygitwithr.com/">Jenny Bryan</a>, so it was just a matter of pushing updates to my website to GitHub and following the blogdown tutorial to build the website.</p>

<h2>Want to make a website? Just try it!</h2>
<p>All of this was completely free, and if you have <em>some</em> knowledge of R Markdown it is super easy to get started. Even if you’ve never used R Markdown, it’s not hard to learn. Depending on the theme you choose, you could get a website up and running in a day or two easily. Feel free to check out the <a href="https://github.com/Aariq/my-website">source documents</a> for this website. I think you’ll find that they are not as intimidating as you might think!</p>

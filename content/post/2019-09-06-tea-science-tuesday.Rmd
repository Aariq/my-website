Tea Science Tuesdays are Instagram live streams where I'll talk informally about some aspect of tea science while enjoying some tea. Each week, there will be a topic, a suggested tea if you want to drink along, and a suggested "reading" (sometimes a video).

Live streams will be at 9:00 AM eastern time @[leafyeric](https://www.instagram.com/leafyeric/). I know that time is probably not good for many people, but don't worry, the streams will be saved and pinned to my Instagram profile and uploaded to a [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtlw9R1NVcT4FtL9LfTtcjdzuiBwkoMus) so you can watch them later.

Here's the "syllabus" for the next few weeks:

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
df <- read_csv(here("static", "files", "tea science tuesday schedule.csv"))
df %>%
  mutate(Reading = glue("[{Reading}](http://{Reading})")) %>% 
  mutate(Reading = ifelse(Paywall, glue("{Reading}*"), Reading)) %>% 
  select(-Paywall, -Notes) %>% 
  kable() %>% 
  kable_styling(full_width = F) %>% 
  column_spec(1, width = "5em")
```

 \* The full article is behind a paywall.  DM me if you need help finding it.

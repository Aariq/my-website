I know you're all waiting on the edge of your seats for an update on the [cupcakes vs. muffins data science project](http://www.ericrscott.com/2018/03/05/cupcakes-vs-muffins/), but unfortunately I don't have any answers to that age-old question* yet. 

As silly as it may sound, I'm actually considering using this data set for a paper about using PLS (partial least squares regression) for ecological data. So for now, I'm holding off on blogging about any results of analyses in case I end up wanting to use them for the publication. In the meantime, the fully cleaned (I hope) [dataset is up on github](https://github.com/Aariq/cupcakes-vs-muffins), so feel free to play around with it. Once I have a general outline for this paper, I may feel more comfortable blogging about the results. Please comment if you think I'm being silly and overparanoid about holding back on this.

*all I can say is muffins probably differ from cupcakes by more than just frosting, based on the ingredients.

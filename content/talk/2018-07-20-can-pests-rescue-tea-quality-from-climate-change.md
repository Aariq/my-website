abstract: 'Insect attack is usually considered bad for tea yield and quality.  However, it is well known that plants produce many secondary metabolites in response to insect attack.  Many of these secondary metabolites are important for tea quality, and some tea farmers have begun to take advantage of insects to improve the quality of their tea.  Will this strategy continue to help improve tea quality under climate change, or will climate change change the way tea plants respond to insect herbivory?'

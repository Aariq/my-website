abstract = "The four species of *Dasineura Rondani* previously reported from goldenrods in North America were revisited, resulting in the synonymy of two species and the redescription of diagnostic characters of adults and galls. *Dasineura folliculi* Felt is reported from *Solidago rugosa* Miller and *S. gigantea* Aiton, and *D. carbonaria* Felt is reported from *Euthamia graminifolia* (L.) Nuttall. Both species induce simple leaf-cluster galls on shoot tips of their relative hosts. *Dasineura folliculi* completes for to five generations, and *D. carbonaria* completes at least two generations between May and October. Emergence rates were relatively low; they ranged from 36 to 51%, suggesting a large proportion of the larval population does not pupate and instead enters diapause in the ground. *D. folliculi* galls were attacked by five species of parasitic wasps and by inquilinous and predatory gall midges and caterpillars. Levels of attack by parasitoids increased, whereas levels of attack by inquilines decreased, as the season progressed. Field data and greenhouse experiments indicated that both Dasineura species exhibit monogeny, whereby females produce unisexual broods. Galls resulting from a single oviposition event exclusively yielded single-sex adults, whereas 7â€“33% of field-collected galls yielded adults of both sexes, suggesting they contained the progeny of more than one female. Gall sex ratios differed between generations of *D. folliculi* on *S. rugosa* but not on *S. gigantea*."

abstract = "*Macrolabis americana* Dorchin n. sp. is a newly discovered species of inquilinous gall midge found in galls of *Dasineura folliculi* Felt on two goldenrod species, *Solidago rugosa* Miller and *Solidago gigantea* Aiton (Asteraceae) in central Pennsylvania. This is the first record of *Macrolabis* outside the Palaearctic, where the genus is represented by 58 species. Contrary to what is known of most *Macrolabis* species, the new species is multivoltine and is found in galls induced by successive generations of *D. folliculi*. Despite certain biological similarities to *Macrolabis solidaginis* Fedotova, which is associated with *Dasineura* galls on goldenrod in Kazakhstan, its relations to its Eurasian congeners are currently unknown. Adults, larvae, galls, and life history of the new species are described."

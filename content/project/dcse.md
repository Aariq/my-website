When I started my Ph.D., I knew I needed a very portable, robust way of sampling plant volatiles in the field.  I was going to be doing my work on tea farms in China, potentially far from a lab or even a source of electricity, so I didn't want to rely on the typical plant volatile sampling method used at the time---dynamic headspace sampling.  Dynamic headspace sampling requires a pump (and a power source) to pull or push air through a container placed around a plant or plant part, then through a sorbent tube that traps the volatiles.  Besides not being easily portable and having replication limited somewhat by the number of pumps, this method introduces a lot of opportunity for contamination from the chamber materials, loss of volatiles due to breakthrough on the sorbent tube, and puts plants in an unnatural environment (in a hot, uv-filtered glass bottle or plastic bag). In collaboration with Nicole Kfoury, a graduate student in Albert Robbat's lab in the Tufts Chemistry department, we created and tested a new application for the magnetic sorptive stir bars (Twisters) they used routinely for sampling volatiles from liquids.  We though "Hey, these Twisters are magnetic.  Could we just stick them on a plant leaf with a magnet on the other side and sample leaf volatiles?"  I brought some Twisters with me on my first field season in China and that was the start of a wonderful collaboration that lead to the creation of a new robust, high-througput method for sampling volatiles in the field that we call [Direct Contact Sorptive Extraction](/publication/dcse/), or DCSE for short.

I've been teaching biology ever since I was 12 when I became an interpretive guide at the [Lindsay Wildlife Experience](https://lindsaywildlife.org/) in my home town of Walnut Creek, CA.  Since then I've taught science of all sorts to all ages in a variety of formats.

## Selected Teaching Experience:

 - **Biostatstics in R**. *Fall 2017*. Recitation section for BIO132 at Tufts University. In collaboration with Natalie Kerr, we designed and taught this new course.  Previously, BIO132 used SPSS rather than R and did not have a required recitation.
 - **Organisms and Populations**. *Spring 2015*. Lab section for BIO0014 at Tufts University.  I served as a graduate TA for a lab section of this course in a year when the course was being entirely redesigned.  I actively participated in designing course materials and lab activities in addition to teaching my own lab section.
 - **Introductory Biology**.  *2011 -- 2014*. I taught a guaranteed transfer credit lecture and lab course at Front Range Community College in Fort Collins, CO where I was an instructor.  My students came from diverse age, socioeconomic, and learning backgrounds.  I designed lectures and assessment materials and engaged in revising lab exercises and course materials.
 - **Organismal and Evolutionary Biology. MIST section**. *2007 -- 2009*. I was a graduate TA for IB150 at University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign as a graduate student. [MIST](http://merit.illinois.edu/index.html) is a program for high-achieving students from marginalized backgrounds such as small, rural schools or large, urban schools that encourages students to form peer learning groups through additional in-class time and active learning.

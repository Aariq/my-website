      <title>RStudio::conf reflections</title>
      <link>/2019/01/23/rstudio-conf-reflections/</link>

      <guid>/2019/01/23/rstudio-conf-reflections/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This was my first time attending &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rstudio.com/conference/&#34;&gt;RStudio::conf&lt;/a&gt;, and I went primarily to explore my career options in data science. I mainly stuck to teaching and modeling related talks since that’s how I already use R. Here are my major takeaways from the conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;shiny-is-the-new-hotness&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Shiny is the new hotness&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://shiny.rstudio.com/&#34;&gt;Shiny&lt;/a&gt; apps are interactive web apps that run on R code, and there was a big focus on Shiny development at the conference this year. Almost everyone I talked to was using Shiny in their jobs including creating &lt;a href=&#34;https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/bus-dashboard.html&#34;&gt;dashboards&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://laderast.github.io/burro/&#34;&gt;interactive exploratory data analysis&lt;/a&gt;, guiding industry researchers through statistical analyses, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://kbodwin.shinyapps.io/Lab_Exercise_tDist/&#34;&gt;teaching focused apps&lt;/a&gt; built on the &lt;code&gt;learnr&lt;/code&gt; package. There was also a lot of focus on scaling Shiny apps so many users could access apps simultaneously without significant slowdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been toying with the idea of creating a Shiny app to help with my own work in doing some data quality checks on GC/MS data, and this gave me the inspiration to commit to doing it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;rstudio-cloud-makes-teaching-r-painless&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;RStudio Cloud makes teaching R painless&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve taught an &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Aariq/biotstatistics-recitation-2018&#34;&gt;intro to R for Biostatistics&lt;/a&gt; course twice now, and both times the first day of class feels like 80% fixing package installation errors. &lt;a href=&#34;https://rstudio.cloud/&#34;&gt;RStudio Cloud&lt;/a&gt; allows students to access RStudio through a web interface, without downloading or installing anything. It also lets instructors set up project spaces with all the necessary packages &lt;strong&gt;already installed&lt;/strong&gt;. This allows you to start the first day off with fun stuff, like data visualization, and save the lessons about CRAN and troubleshooting package installations for later. Not only can you set up environments for students to work in, you can also peek into their environments. That means no more “I can maybe help you if you send me your code” emails!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;when-to-make-a-cran-package&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;When to make a CRAN package&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;I wish I&amp;#39;d left this code across scattered .R files instead of combining it into a package&amp;quot; said no one ever &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;#rstats&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://t.co/udeNH4T67H&#34;&gt;http://t.co/udeNH4T67H&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; David Robinson (@drob) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/drob/status/611885584584441856?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;June 19, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had already taken this advice and built a package for myself with all the functions that I’ve written and used in multiple projects. I called it &lt;code&gt;chemhelper&lt;/code&gt; and put it up on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Aariq/chemhelper&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, just in case someone else would find it useful. Now I’m working on a manuscript that uses some of the functions in this package, and I needed advice on what to do to make my analysis reproducible and archivable upon submitting it. You see, &lt;code&gt;webchem&lt;/code&gt; is very much a work in progress, so if I were to archive analysis code that relied on it, it would likely be broken very quickly and therefore not reproducible. One option is submitting my package to CRAN and then recording version information in the analysis code or using something like &lt;a href=&#34;https://rstudio.github.io/packrat/&#34;&gt;packrat&lt;/a&gt;. The advice I got over and over was &lt;strong&gt;if your package is potentially useful to people other than you, put it on CRAN&lt;/strong&gt;. I’ve already started pulling out the functions that are useful to others and plan on submitting a package to CRAN before submitting my manuscript!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;how-we-teach-coding&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;How we teach coding&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the keynote by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/felienne&#34;&gt;@felienne&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;strong&gt;phenomenal&lt;/strong&gt;! You should watch it regardless of your area of interest—it’s &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; kind of talk. With hand-drawn slides and an incredible stage presence, Dr. Felienne Hermans explored the weirdness of how we teach programming. For example, you wouldn’t just hand someone a guitar and say “the best way to learn is to just try changing something and see what happens!” and you also wouldn’t tell a child riding a bike with training wheels “that’s not real biking!”, but we do both of these things regularly when interacting with beginner programmers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, we know empirically that reading out loud (phonics) is a good way to learn languages, and that &lt;em&gt;should include&lt;/em&gt; programming languages. I realized that part of the value in &lt;a href=&#34;http://varianceexplained.org/r/teach-tidyverse/&#34;&gt;teaching tidyverse first&lt;/a&gt; is that you can and &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; read tidyverse code out-loud. I’m definitely going to make classrooms read code outloud in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(dplyr)
iris %&amp;gt;%
  group_by(Species) %&amp;gt;% 
  summarize(mean_petal_length = mean(Petal.Length),
            sd_petal_length = sd(Petal.Length))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Say it with me, class:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take the iris dataset, then&lt;br /&gt;
group it by Species, then&lt;br /&gt;
summarize it by taking the mean and standard deviation of petal length&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was your biggest takeaway from RStudio::conf 2019? Let me know in the comments!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Finding Cryptic Insect Eggs With Fluorescence</title>
      <link>/2018/12/12/leafhopper-egg-method/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 12 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/2018/12/12/leafhopper-egg-method/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently gave a talk on some of my work as a PhD student on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ericrscott.com/project/climate-leafhopper-quality/&#34;&gt;experiments&lt;/a&gt; manipulating densities of the tea green leafhopper (&lt;em&gt;Empoasca onukii&lt;/em&gt;) on tea plants. What the audience liked most, I think, were my methods for finding leafhopper eggs in the field and rearing them in the lab (well, a guest room at a tea farm). You see, leafhoppers (including at least the tea green leafhopper and the small green leafhopper, &lt;em&gt;Empoasca vitis&lt;/em&gt;) lay their eggs &lt;em&gt;inside&lt;/em&gt; plant tissues, making them impossible to find with the naked eye. But, you can take advantage of the fluorescent properties of leafhopper eggs and plants to make them more visible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;&lt;span id=&#34;fig:unnamed-chunk-2&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/img/learning-SLEDA.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;Students from TRI CAAS looking for leafhopper eggs in tea shoots&#34; width=&#34;70%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;
Figure 1: Students from TRI CAAS looking for leafhopper eggs in tea shoots
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that under blue light, leafhopper eggs fluoresce bright green while the chlorophyll in plants fluoresces red. By using blue light to create this fluorescence and blocking the blue light coming to your eyes with a filter, you can easily spot the eggs even though they are under the epidermis of the tea stems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;video autoplay=&#34;TRUE&#34; controls=&#34;TRUE&#34; loop=&#34;TRUE&#34; muted=&#34;TRUE&#34; src=&#34;/img/SLEDA.mp4&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; height=&#34;400&#34; figcaption=&#34;testing&#34;&gt;&lt;/video&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you’re seeing above is video from a smart phone with the lens covered by a pair of orange goggles. I move the beam of a blue LED flashlight (which you can’t really see because of the orange filter) toward the center of the frame, where you see a green dot appear on the tea stem. This is a leafhopper egg. Then I remove the orange goggles so you can see what it looks like without them—totally washed out by blue light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;&lt;span id=&#34;fig:unnamed-chunk-4&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/img/SLEDA-in-lab.png&#34; alt=&#34;A tea shoot lit by ambient light (left) and by blue light, filtered through orange goggles (right).  The leafhopper egg is the small green dot on the stem in the right panel.&#34; width=&#34;70%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;
Figure 2: A tea shoot lit by ambient light (left) and by blue light, filtered through orange goggles (right). The leafhopper egg is the small green dot on the stem in the right panel.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This method is modified from a &lt;a href=&#34;http://link.springer.com/10.1007/BF03356146&#34;&gt;2004 paper by Herrmann and Böll&lt;/a&gt; that was written before bright blue LEDs were widely available, and calls for the use of full-spectrum white light from a halogen bulb passed through a filter. Now, blue LED flashlights are cheap and widely available, providing a much more portable solution for field sampling. I used a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/WAYLLSHINE-Flashlight-Adjustable-Camping-Activities/dp/B00WD0XFAW&#34;&gt;small blue flashlight&lt;/a&gt; I bought from Amazon for my light source, and some &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Uvex-S0360X-Ultra-spec-SCT-Orange-Anti-Fog/dp/B003OBZ64M/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1544637112&amp;amp;sr=8-3&amp;amp;keywords=uvex+orange+goggles&#34;&gt;orange, UV-blocking goggles&lt;/a&gt; for my blue light filter, but &lt;strong&gt;any&lt;/strong&gt; blue light source and orange goggles should work! I should also mention, that this is best done at dusk or nighttime to improve visibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you’re working in a vineyard to monitor &lt;em&gt;Empoasca vitis&lt;/em&gt;, trying to rear leafhoppers from eggs, or trying to count eggs in an oviposition choice experiment, using this method will save you time and frustration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;acknowledgements&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Acknowledgements:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guan-Hua Liu and Long Jiao helped to confirm that the eggs I was finding were &lt;em&gt;Empoasca onukii&lt;/em&gt; eggs. Thanks guys!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Trip to Uji</title>
      <link>/2018/11/07/trip-to-uji/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 07 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/2018/11/07/trip-to-uji/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;At the end of my &lt;a href=&#34;2018-07-20-last-fieldwork-season&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;last field season&lt;/a&gt;, I was lucky enough to be joined by my wife for some vacationing.  We spent about a week in China, and about a week in Kyoto, Japan, a mecca for Japanese green tea lovers.  It was &lt;em&gt;hot&lt;/em&gt; in August, and the super umami iced sencha we were offered at hotels and restaurants was a refreshing change from only hot beverages in China. Near the end of our stay, we took a day trip to Uji.  I was initially expecting Uji to be a bustling upscale downtown full of tea shops surrounded by tea gardens.  But what I heard from all our guide books was that it was mostly a tea-themed tourist trap.  Either way, I was down to experience it first-hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our way down, we had planned to make a stop at Inari temple, and last minute decided to first go to Fukuji temple, since it was on the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;picture of tofukuji&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After wandering the temple grounds at Fukuji, we decided to walk to Inari temple.  It was only about a 15 min walk, and it didn&amp;rsquo;t seem worth it to get back on the train.  We were, however, unprepared for the amount of walking necessary at Inari temple.  We knew it was famous for it&amp;rsquo;s paths covered with organge painted gateways, but we didn&amp;rsquo;t know that those paths went &lt;strong&gt;to the top of a mountain&lt;/strong&gt;. My legs were &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; tired after our morning stroll from Fukuji compounded with almost two weeks of walking an average of 10 miles a day. Every time we thought we were making progress, we would come across a YOU ARE HERE map that made it seem like we&amp;rsquo;d never get to the top.  Then, more orange gates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, we gave up.  We think we made it almost &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; of the way, to a spot with a very nice view.  If there was any hope of us making it to Uji with our leg muscles intact, we had to turn back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made it to Uji and shuffled doggedly to our first stop, Kyoryouri Ujigawa, a restaurant overlooking the Uji river that I found out about from Ricardo Caicedo&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.myjapanesegreentea.com/uji-press-tea-tour-2016-part-3&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;.  It was green tea everything!  Matcha soba, inari sushi with matcha sprinkled on top, tempura tea leaf, and of course a cup of sencha.  The restaurant is on the third floor and all tatami mats.  It was &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; wonderful to kick off our shoes and eat some delicous food while taking in the view.  We were refreshed and ready to do some shopping!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[restaurant]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We headed across the river to ____ which was one of the oldest tea shops in Uji.  I had come to Uji with intentions to buy some gyokuoro&amp;mdash;the super ummami result of shading tea plants for several weeks before harvest.  I knew it would be expensive, but without any way to taste it before buying (we &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; given a sample of some delicious sencha), we decided to move on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[pic outside of tea shop]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ended up at another bookmarked spot, _____, also extremely old and in continous operation&amp;hellip;..  Here, their tea offerings were much more accessible.  Their wall of tea was organized with separate shelves for gyokuro, sencha, and other teas such as houjicha and genmaicha.  From left to right, teas increased in quality, price, and concentration of that delicious umami tasting amino acid, L-theanine.  On the top shelf were the, well, top-shelf teas!  We were offered a sample of a mid-range gyokuro which was already &lt;strong&gt;so&lt;/strong&gt; umami that it was almost unpleasant.  Amazing stuff, but not something I&amp;rsquo;d want to drink all the time.  Eventually we decided that the good sencha was worlds better than the gyokuro we usually have access to in the US, so we picked up some sencha and some kukicha made from gyokuro stems and called it a tea shopping success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[tea shop wall of tea]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next stop, snack time!  Feeling accomplished in tea shopping, we went &lt;em&gt;back&lt;/em&gt; across the bridge to the first place we went to for delicious matcha with sweets in it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[matcha snacks]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made one final stop on the way out of town to get souvenirs.  This shop was all matcha everything.  Matcha chocolate, matcha cookies, matcha ice cream, matcha mochi, matcha cakes, and, of course, matcha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[uji mailbox shaped like a tea jar]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My legs and hips hurting, we made it back to the trainstation and got some pictures with the Uji city mascott (a baby with green hair, a matcha whisk on his head, and a cape that says &amp;ldquo;tea&amp;rdquo;) and heading back to our hotel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[uji mascott]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the town of Uji wasn&amp;rsquo;t what I expected or what I had heard it would be. It was a small sleepy town, which was definitely tea-themed and touristy, but not the tourist &lt;em&gt;trap&lt;/em&gt; I had been told it would be.  The matcha and matcha products I tasted were all what would be considered high-quality in the US, so even if we were getting the cheap stuff, it was some of the best I&amp;rsquo;d had.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Use of partial least squares regression (PLS) in ecology</title>
      <link>/project/pls-ecology/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 12 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/project/pls-ecology/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As ecology datasets become increasingly larger due to citizen science, high-throughput methods, and remote and automated data collection technology, we need better methods to analyze multivariate data. A typical approach to multivariate data in ecology is to use principal components analysis, an unsupervised technique. Unsupervised techniques like PCA attempt to explain as much &lt;em&gt;variation&lt;/em&gt; in the data as possible in fewer axes or ‘latent variables’ than there are variables in the data set. Separation in a PCA score plot (of the two axes that explain the most variation in the data) are then often used to make some conclusions about clustering of data points into separate groups, or about the effects of some explanatory variable. However, the variables that most strongly differentiate two groups, or most strongly co-vary with some explanatory variable are not necessarily the same variables loaded onto the PCA axes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Partial least squares regression (PLS, alternately ‘projection to latent structures’) is a supervised multivariate statistical technique. PLS, a supervised technique, attempts to explain &lt;em&gt;covariation&lt;/em&gt; with a explanatory variable, and it’s built with more variables than samples in mind. Because of that, it’s been warmly adopted by analytic chemists and chemical ecologists, but I believe it has applications to other fields of ecology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;&lt;span id=&#34;fig:unnamed-chunk-1&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/img/PLSvsPCA.png&#34; alt=&#34;A schematic of PCA (A) compared to PLS (B).  In a PCA score plot (right), the x axis is a combination of variables (in this example, the three metabolites) that explains the most variation in the data, regardless of group membership.  PLS, on the other-hand, attempts to explain the co-variation with an explanatory variable (&#39;Treatment&#39; in this example).&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;
Figure 1: A schematic of PCA (A) compared to PLS (B). In a PCA score plot (right), the x axis is a combination of variables (in this example, the three metabolites) that explains the most variation in the data, regardless of group membership. PLS, on the other-hand, attempts to explain the co-variation with an explanatory variable (‘Treatment’ in this example).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, researchers used to looking for visual separation in PCA score plots may be prone to misinterpreting PLS score plots because even when separation is not statistically significant, they may still show visual separation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to bring awareness to this algorithm and promote responsible use, I’m simulating different multivariate data scenarios using some &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Aariq/chemhelper&#34;&gt;custom R functions&lt;/a&gt; to investigate it’s properties and compare its performance to other statistical methods. I’m also developing a ‘best practices’ for reporting results of PLS analyses, and finding some fun ecological and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ericrscott.com/2018/03/05/cupcakes-vs-muffins/&#34;&gt;non-ecological&lt;/a&gt; datasets to demonstrate its properties with.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Last Fieldwork Season in China</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m currently in Hangzhou, China at the &lt;a href=&#34;www.tricaas.com&#34;&gt;Tea Research Institute&lt;/a&gt;(TRI) for my fourth and last time. It’s bitter sweet (like my favorite teas ;-) ) since I’m both glad to be nearing the end of my PhD, and sad to say goodbye to all the friends I’ve made and a city I’ve really grown to enjoy living in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;fieldwork&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fieldwork&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This final summer, I’ve been focusing on a few experiments having to do with leafhoppers and their effects on tea chemistry (see the &lt;a href=&#34;/project/climate-leafhopper-quality/&#34;&gt;project page&lt;/a&gt; for more info). I’m repeating an experiment from last year, where I put different densities of insects on tea plants and measure the chemistry, but this time using two different cultivars to see if they respond differently to insect attack.&lt;/p&gt;
I’m also trying my hand at making oolong tea!
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;&lt;span id=&#34;fig:unnamed-chunk-2&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/img/myoolong.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Jin Guan Yin leaves after two rounds of gentle bruising&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is part of an experiment aiming to better understand when leafhoppers are a pest, and when they can improve tea quality. They’re definitely considered a pest to farmers that make green tea, but prized by some farmers making &lt;a href=&#34;https://specialtyteaalliance.org/world-of-tea/oriental-beauty-bug-bitten-teas/&#34;&gt;Eastern Beauty oolong&lt;/a&gt;. There are &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; reasons for this, but I’m curious about how tea leaves react during processing after being previously damaged by leafhoppers. I’ve written a bit about this on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.teageek.net/blog/2018/03/oolong-mid-oxidized/&#34;&gt;TeaGeek&lt;/a&gt; before, so you can read more about what’s going on during oolong processing there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m doing these two experiments at TRI’s new-ish experimental field station in near-by Shengzhou.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;&lt;span id=&#34;fig:unnamed-chunk-3&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is rather boring there since there are hardly any other students working there, it’s in a rural area, and it has barely functioning internet. But the weather last week there was &lt;em&gt;amazing&lt;/em&gt;. It was dry! It was actually dry! In China! I’ve never been anywhere &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; extremely humid in China. In fact, it felt like home (California). Hot, dry, cool breezes at night, scattered fluffy clouds—perfect. I’ve always been lucky in that whenever I’m doing really grueling, repetitive, sweaty fieldwork, it’s at least been somewhere beautiful. That really keeps me going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;people&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;People&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m so happy to see old friends and meet new ones! I’ve been working closely with Dr. Li Xin and his masters student, Wei Ji Peng for the past 3 years and it’s great to see them again. I’ve also made friends in other departments (it’s easy to make friends at a tea research institute when you’re a foreign tea geek!) and it’s great to see them again as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;&lt;span id=&#34;fig:unnamed-chunk-4&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/img/lixin-weijipeng.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Wei Ji-Peng (left), me (center), and Dr. Li Xin (right) at the Shengzhou experimental station&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve also been lucky to have a Chinese REU student working with me this summer. Her name is Guo Ming Ming, and she’s been extremely helpful in carrying out experiments, catching leafhoppers, and translating (no, even after 4 years I do not speak Mandarin well enough to do much of anything on my own).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;&lt;span id=&#34;fig:unnamed-chunk-5&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;computer-work&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Computer work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fieldwork is fun, but its far too hot to work outside for most of the day. So I usually finish my morning work before breakfast most days, and occasionally do some work in the evening. Of course there are longer days for setting up experiments, but most of the time I’m in an office. I’ve been working a lot on writing and coding for a paper about using partial least squares regression (PLS) on ecological data. I’m learning a lot in the process, and I can’t wait to share it with everyone (it might even include &lt;a href=&#34;/2018/03/05/cupcakes-vs-muffins/&#34;&gt;cupcakes vs. muffins&lt;/a&gt;!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Retrieve chemical retention indices from NIST with {webchem}!</title>
      <link>/2018/06/28/webchem/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 28 Jun 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/2018/06/28/webchem/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My PhD has involved learning a lot more than I expected about analytical chemistry, and as I’ve been learning, I’ve been trying my best to make my life easier by writing R functions to help me out. Some of those functions have found a loving home in the &lt;code&gt;webchem&lt;/code&gt; package, part of &lt;a href=&#34;https://ropensci.org/&#34;&gt;rOpenSci&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Papers that use gas chromatography to separate and measure chemicals often include a table of the compounds they found along with experimental retention indices and literature retention indices. A retention index is basically a corrected retention time—the time it took for the particular chemical to make it through the gas chromatograph, an instrument designed to separate chemicals, to the detector used to identify the compound (e.g. an FID or mass spectrometer). While the retention time for a particular compound might vary from run to run or beetween labs, the retention &lt;strong&gt;index&lt;/strong&gt; should be comparable. Therefore, they are often used to help identify compounds and &lt;a href=&#34;https://webbook.nist.gov/chemistry/&#34;&gt;NIST&lt;/a&gt; maintains a database of retention indeces for researchers to refer to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Producing such a table of literature retention indices for potentially hundreds of metabolites by hand can be really tedious!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter &lt;code&gt;nist_ri()&lt;/code&gt;, a handy function I wrote to scrape retention index tables from NIST. Below, I work through an example of how you might use it. First, you need to install the latest version of &lt;code&gt;webchem&lt;/code&gt;. My function isn’t in the latest CRAN release at the time of writing this blog post, but you can install from github like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;devtools::install_github(&amp;quot;ropensci/webchem&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To look up a retention index, you need a CAS identifier number for the chemical (For now, at least. Other search methods may be implemented in the future). If you don’t already have CAS numbers, you can get them using other functions in &lt;code&gt;webchem&lt;/code&gt; from chemical names or other identifier numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;CASs &amp;lt;- c(&amp;quot;83-34-1&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;119-36-8&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;123-35-3&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;19700-21-1&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Load the package and take a look at the help file. You’ll see that we need to choose what type of retention index to scrape, what polarity of column, and what kind of teperature program. If you browse one of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://webbook.nist.gov/cgi/cbook.cgi?ID=C78706&amp;amp;Units=SI&amp;amp;Mask=2000#Gas-Chrom&#34;&gt;NIST sites for a compound&lt;/a&gt;, this will make more sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(webchem)
?nist_ri&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s get Van Den Dool &amp;amp; Kratz (AKA “linear”) retention indeces for non-polar columns using a temperature ramp. This might take a while, depending on your internet connection and how many CAS numbers you request data for. If a certain type of retention index doesn’t exist for a compound, the function will return &lt;code&gt;NA&lt;/code&gt; for all columns but the CAS number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;RIs &amp;lt;- nist_ri(CASs, &amp;quot;linear&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;non-polar&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;ramp&amp;quot;)
head(RIs)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see there are multiple retention indices (&lt;code&gt;RI&lt;/code&gt;) for each CAS number. Let’s filter this down some more using some functions from &lt;code&gt;dplyr&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;stringr&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
RIs_filtered &amp;lt;-
  RIs %&amp;gt;%
  filter(gas == &amp;quot;Helium&amp;quot;,
         between(length, 20, 30),
         str_detect(phase, &amp;quot;5&amp;quot;),
         diameter &amp;lt; 0.3,
         thickness == 0.25)
head(RIs_filtered)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we could &lt;code&gt;summarise&lt;/code&gt; to get an average of all the database entries…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;RIs_filtered %&amp;gt;% 
  group_by(CAS) %&amp;gt;% 
  summarise(mean_RI = mean(RI))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or if we wanted to pick a single entry for each CAS number with the median RI, we could do that as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;best_RIs &amp;lt;-
  RIs_filtered %&amp;gt;%
  group_by(CAS) %&amp;gt;% 
  filter(RI == median(RI)) %&amp;gt;% 
  filter(row_number() == 1) %&amp;gt;% 
  select(CAS, RI, reference)
best_RIs&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could then easily take this table and &lt;code&gt;*_join()&lt;/code&gt; it to your GC/MS data, if you have a column for CAS#, and select the &lt;code&gt;RI&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;reference&lt;/code&gt; columns, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;fake.data &amp;lt;-
  data.frame(CAS = CASs,
             #Name = cts_convert(CASs, from = &amp;quot;CAS&amp;quot;, to = &amp;quot;Chemical Name&amp;quot;, first = TRUE),
             Name = c(&amp;quot;skatole&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;methyl salicylate&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;beta-myrcene&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;geosmin&amp;quot;),
             group_1_conc = round(abs(rnorm(4)), 3),
             group_2_conc = round(abs(rnorm(4)), 3))

left_join(fake.data, best_RIs) %&amp;gt;%
  select(CAS, Name, RI, everything()) %&amp;gt;% 
  arrange(RI) %&amp;gt;%
  knitr::kable()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

      <title>Python is Weird (an unabashedly biased intro to Python for R users)</title>
      <link>/2018/05/03/python-is-weird/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 03 May 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/2018/05/03/python-is-weird/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Last semester I took a class that used Python. It was my first time really seriously using any programing language other than R. The students were about half engineers and half biologists.  The vast majority of the biologists knew R to varying degrees, but had no experience with Python, and the engineers seemed to generally have some experience with Python, or at least with languages more similar to it than R. I wish that the instructor could have taught every Python lecture like &amp;ldquo;Ok, today we&amp;rsquo;re going to learn the Python equivalent of doing ____ in R&amp;rdquo;, but of course that wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be fair to about half the students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So for anyone else making the leap from R to Python, here are three things that are going to feel really weird about Python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;1-indexing-is-not-intuitive-in-python&#34;&gt;1. Indexing is not intuitive in Python&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me just show you first and see if you can figure out what is going on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;R Code:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;# R
x = c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50)
x[1]
x[1:3]
x[4:5]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 10
## [1] 10 20 30
## [1] 40 50
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cool, cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Equivalent in Python:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;# Python
x = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
print(x[1])
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## 20
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;print(x[0])
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## 10
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;print(x[3:4])
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [40]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;print(x[3:5])
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [40, 50]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait, what? Two things are really weird about this.  First, the first position in the vector is not position 1, it is position 0.  Second, &lt;code&gt;x[3:4]&lt;/code&gt; returns only a single number.  Why?!  Because in Python, the second number in the index is not inclusive, so if you want to get the 4th and 5th values of &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; (index positions 3 and 4 in Python world), then you have to use &lt;code&gt;x[3:5]&lt;/code&gt; &lt;strong&gt;even though there is NO POSITION 5&lt;/strong&gt;.  Terrible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Weird thing 1.1: Python is much more geared toward writing programs than R.  That means you can&amp;rsquo;t really run python code one line at a time like R and you have to explicitly &lt;code&gt;print()&lt;/code&gt; things that you want to be output to the screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;2-you-need-to-load-a-package-just-to-do-vector-math&#34;&gt;2. You need to load a package just to do vector math&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;R is built for doing math and statistics, so vectors and matrices are built in and you can do math on them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;R Code:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;# R
x = c(1, 2, 3)
x + 10
x * 2
y = c(5, 6, 7)
x + y
#Yay vector arithmetic!
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 11 12 13
## [1] 2 4 6
## [1]  6  8 10
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Python is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; built with math and statistics in mind, and this doesn&amp;rsquo;t work without using a package.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Equivalent in Python:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;# Python
x = [1, 2, 3]
print(x + [10]) 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1, 2, 3, 10]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;print(x*3) 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;y = [5, 6, 7]
print(x + y) 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; is doing something different in base Python&amp;mdash;it&amp;rsquo;s concatenating &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;10&lt;/code&gt;.  Similarly, &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; is not multiplying, but concatenating three &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;s in a row. This is completely ridiculous behavior for numbers, but when you&amp;rsquo;re working with strings, it&amp;rsquo;s actually pretty freakin&amp;rsquo; great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;# Python
print((&amp;quot;Yay &amp;quot;+&amp;quot;Python! &amp;quot;) * 5)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## Yay Python! Yay Python! Yay Python! Yay Python! Yay Python!
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want numerical vectors to work like they should, you have to use a special kind of vector called a &lt;strong&gt;numpy array&lt;/strong&gt;.  Numpy is a package for Python that provides a bunch of functions that work on numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;# Python
import numpy as np
x = np.array([1, 2, 3])
print(x + 10)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [11 12 13]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;print(x * 2) 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [2 4 6]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;y = np.array([5, 6, 7])
print(x + y)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [ 6  8 10]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do math to numpy arrays, you get what you&amp;rsquo;d expect as an R user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wierd thing 2.1: note that the &lt;code&gt;packagename.function()&lt;/code&gt; form is equivalent to &lt;code&gt;packagename::function()&lt;/code&gt; in R, but unlike R, it is always required.  That is, as far as I know, there is nothing you can do to make &lt;code&gt;array([1,2,3])&lt;/code&gt; work without the preceding &lt;code&gt;np.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;3-default-assignment-behavior-is-aliasing&#34;&gt;3. Default assignment behavior is aliasing&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m still trying to wrap my mind around this one, so rather than trying to explain it, let me show you an example first:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;R Code:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;# R
a1 = c(1,2,3)
a2 = a1
a2[1] = 100
a1
a2
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 1 2 3
## [1] 100   2   3
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;a1&lt;/code&gt; is, of course, unchanged by changing a value in &lt;code&gt;a2&lt;/code&gt;.  Let&amp;rsquo;s see if that&amp;rsquo;s true in Python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Equivalent in Python:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;# Python
import numpy as np
a1 = np.array([1,2,3])
a2 = a1
a2[1] = 100
print(a1)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [  1 100   3]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;print(a2)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [  1 100   3]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Changing a value in &lt;code&gt;a2&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em&gt;changes&lt;/em&gt; the same value in &lt;code&gt;a1&lt;/code&gt;! In this case, &lt;code&gt;a2&lt;/code&gt; is an &lt;em&gt;alias&lt;/em&gt; of &lt;code&gt;a1&lt;/code&gt;, not a copy. This only happens when you do &lt;code&gt;object1 = object2&lt;/code&gt; and not when you do something to &lt;code&gt;object2&lt;/code&gt; as you&amp;rsquo;re assigning it. Here&amp;rsquo;s another example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;# Python
import numpy as np
a1 = np.array([1,2,3])
a2 = a1 + 2
a2[1] = 100
print(a1)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1 2 3]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;print(a2)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [  3 100   5]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now &lt;code&gt;a2&lt;/code&gt; is a separate object from &lt;code&gt;a1&lt;/code&gt; instead of just an alias. If you want to make an &lt;em&gt;exact&lt;/em&gt; copy, you have to do that explicitly with &lt;code&gt;a2 = np.copy(a1)&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;a2 = a1[:]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;try-python&#34;&gt;Try Python!&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As many people in the data science world have pointed out, it&amp;rsquo;s not R vs. Python, it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/r-vs-python-r-and-python-and-something-else&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;R &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; Python&lt;/a&gt;. From my limited experience, the benefits of Python over R I&amp;rsquo;ve are that it seems to be faster, defining classes and functions seems less painful, and it&amp;rsquo;s great at working with strings out of the box. I don&amp;rsquo;t really plan on working in Python more unless I have to, but knowing a bit of the language will be useful for talking shop with people who use it!&lt;/p&gt;

      <div class="article-style" itemprop="articleBody">
        <p>At the end of my <a href="2018-07-20-last-fieldwork-season" target="_blank">last field season</a>, I was lucky enough to be joined by my wife for some vacationing.  We spent about a week in China, and about a week in Kyoto, Japan, a mecca for Japanese green tea lovers.  It was <em>hot</em> in August, and the super umami iced sencha we were offered at hotels and restaurants was a refreshing change from only hot beverages in China. Near the end of our stay, we took a day trip to Uji.  I was initially expecting Uji to be a bustling upscale downtown full of tea shops surrounded by tea gardens.  But what I heard from all our guide books was that it was mostly a tea-themed tourist trap.  Either way, I was down to experience it first-hand.</p>

<p>On our way down, we had planned to make a stop at Inari temple, and last minute decided to first go to Fukuji temple, since it was on the way.</p>

<p>picture of tofukuji</p>

<p>After wandering the temple grounds at Fukuji, we decided to walk to Inari temple.  It was only about a 15 min walk, and it didn&rsquo;t seem worth it to get back on the train.  We were, however, unprepared for the amount of walking necessary at Inari temple.  We knew it was famous for it&rsquo;s paths covered with organge painted gateways, but we didn&rsquo;t know that those paths went <strong>to the top of a mountain</strong>. My legs were <em>already</em> tired after our morning stroll from Fukuji compounded with almost two weeks of walking an average of 10 miles a day. Every time we thought we were making progress, we would come across a YOU ARE HERE map that made it seem like we&rsquo;d never get to the top.  Then, more orange gates.</p>

<p>Eventually, we gave up.  We think we made it almost <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> of the way, to a spot with a very nice view.  If there was any hope of us making it to Uji with our leg muscles intact, we had to turn back.</p>

<p>We made it to Uji and shuffled doggedly to our first stop, Kyoryouri Ujigawa, a restaurant overlooking the Uji river that I found out about from Ricardo Caicedo&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.myjapanesegreentea.com/uji-press-tea-tour-2016-part-3" target="_blank">blog post</a>.  It was green tea everything!  Matcha soba, inari sushi with matcha sprinkled on top, tempura tea leaf, and of course a cup of sencha.  The restaurant is on the third floor and all tatami mats.  It was <em>so</em> wonderful to kick off our shoes and eat some delicous food while taking in the view.  We were refreshed and ready to do some shopping!</p>

<p>[restaurant]</p>

<p>We headed across the river to ____ which was one of the oldest tea shops in Uji.  I had come to Uji with intentions to buy some gyokuoro&mdash;the super ummami result of shading tea plants for several weeks before harvest.  I knew it would be expensive, but without any way to taste it before buying (we <em>were</em> given a sample of some delicious sencha), we decided to move on.</p>

<p>[pic outside of tea shop]</p>

<p>We ended up at another bookmarked spot, _____, also extremely old and in continous operation&hellip;..  Here, their tea offerings were much more accessible.  Their wall of tea was organized with separate shelves for gyokuro, sencha, and other teas such as houjicha and genmaicha.  From left to right, teas increased in quality, price, and concentration of that delicious umami tasting amino acid, L-theanine.  On the top shelf were the, well, top-shelf teas!  We were offered a sample of a mid-range gyokuro which was already <strong>so</strong> umami that it was almost unpleasant.  Amazing stuff, but not something I&rsquo;d want to drink all the time.  Eventually we decided that the good sencha was worlds better than the gyokuro we usually have access to in the US, so we picked up some sencha and some kukicha made from gyokuro stems and called it a tea shopping success.</p>

<p>[tea shop wall of tea]</p>

<p>Next stop, snack time!  Feeling accomplished in tea shopping, we went <em>back</em> across the bridge to the first place we went to for delicious matcha with sweets in it!</p>

<p>[matcha snacks]</p>

<p>We made one final stop on the way out of town to get souvenirs.  This shop was all matcha everything.  Matcha chocolate, matcha cookies, matcha ice cream, matcha mochi, matcha cakes, and, of course, matcha.</p>

<p>[uji mailbox shaped like a tea jar]</p>

<p>My legs and hips hurting, we made it back to the trainstation and got some pictures with the Uji city mascott (a baby with green hair, a matcha whisk on his head, and a cape that says &ldquo;tea&rdquo;) and heading back to our hotel.</p>

<p>[uji mascott]</p>

<p>Overall, the town of Uji wasn&rsquo;t what I expected or what I had heard it would be. It was a small sleepy town, which was definitely tea-themed and touristy, but not the tourist <em>trap</em> I had been told it would be.  The matcha and matcha products I tasted were all what would be considered high-quality in the US, so even if we were getting the cheap stuff, it was some of the best I&rsquo;d had.</p>
